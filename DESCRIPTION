Description: Extra family objects in "weird" scenarios, e.g., logistic or log-linear model with unbounded or non-binary/non-integer outcomes. Provides 'binomial_extra' and 'poisson_extra' as generalizations of 'binomial' and 'poisson'. The use of canonical link with the corresponding working likelihood ensures convexity, makeing model fitting reliable and independent of starting value.
