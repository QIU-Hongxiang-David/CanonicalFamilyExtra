\title{Family object for fitting binomial (e.g., logistic, probit) regression model with potentially unbounded continuous outcome}
\usage{
binomial_extra(
  link = "logit",
  variance = "mu(1-mu)",
  family = c("gaussian", "binomial")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{link}{see \code{\link[stats:family]{family}}. Default to \code{"logit"}}

\item{variance}{see \code{\link[stats:family]{family}}. Default to \code{"mu(1-mu)"}, same as logistic regression.}

\item{family}{The family of the returned family object. Either \code{"gaussian"} or \code{"binomial"}. Default to \code{"gaussian"}. Seems not to matter for glm.}
}
\value{
a family object
}
\description{
A family object for fitting binomial models (i.e., generalized linear models with range contained in the open unit interval \eqn{(0,1)}) with continuous outcomes that may fall outside the unit interval \eqn{[0,1]}. Also works with \code{\link[glmnet:glmnet]{glmnet}}.
}
\details{
This family is useful, for example, when the estimand is a conditional probability function while the outcome is a transformed psudo-outcome so that the estimator is multiply robust, or estimating a regression function with known bounds while the outcome might not respect the known bounds. Naive approaches such as \code{glm(family=binomial())}, \code{glm(family=quasibinomial())}, \code{glm(family=gaussian(link="logit"))}, \code{glm(family=quasi(link="logit",variance="constant"))} etc. might not work appropriately in such cases.

Particularly for logistic model, because of using the binomial working likelihood and its canonical link, the model fitting is a convex problem and does not depend on starting value.

The output has \code{family="gaussian"} by default to be compatible with other learners in \code{\link[SuperLearner:SuperLearner]{SuperLearner::SuperLearner}}, because when the outcome is continuous, other learners might not perform correctly with \code{family="binomial"}.
